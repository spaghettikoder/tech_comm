# Effects of Social Media on Teens

Nowadays, the majority of teenagers spend their free time on social networks. There is still an ongoing argument among scientists about the harm and benefits of social media on adolescents. Social networks have become a tool for exploring the world and self-expression. Communication is no longer limited to a certain circle of people with whom the teenager can meet physically. Therefore, this topic raises a serious problem: how could the social network environment influence teenagers?

## Positive Effects

1. **Self-Development:** Social networks have a huge database of videos and audio materials and recorded lessons about various topics, from culinary recipes to international politics which teens can access freely and without effort. This accessibility encourages continuous learning and supports self-improvement. Many teens use social media platforms to follow educational channels,keep up with modern technologies, acquire new skills, and engage in online courses, which contribute to their personal and academic development.

2. **Making Friends:** Communication has been simplified to the maximum. A huge physical distance of thousands of miles is no longer a barrier to communicating with others. All that is needed is internet connection. And with the help of various applications, teenagers can easily find other people who share similar interests and opinions and build meaningful friendships with them. These digital friendships can broaden teens' perspectives, introduce them to diverse cultures, and offer emotional support, especially when physical friendships are limited.

## Negative Effects

1. **Physical and Mental Health:** Spending too much time on social media and consuming its content non-stop can have harmful effects on teenagers. The overwhelming flow of information can manipulate their emotions and shape their views on various topics in unexpected ways. Additionally, being constantly exposed to the online world makes teens more vulnerable to harassment, humiliation, and cyberbullying.

Moreover, prolonged screen time reduces physical activity. This lack of movement can cause physical health problems such as obesity, eye strain, and poor posture. On the mental health side, overuse of social networks may increase feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness among teenagers.

2. **Communication Skills:** While social networks connect people virtually, they often limit real-life interaction. Teenagers need to practice real communication to develop critical social skills such as active listening, discussing and debating ideas, and resolving conflicts. However, on social media, communication is often expressed by likes, emojis, and short messages, which lack depth and meaning. As a result, excessive dependency on social media can negatively influence on teens' ability to express themselves clearly, understand body language, and build confidence in real-life conversations.

## Conclusion

Although social media offers many benefits for teenagers, such as self-development and the opportunity to make new friends, it also has negative effects on their physical and mental health, as well as on their communication skills. To ensure a healthy balance, teens should be encouraged to use social networks wisely and prioritize real-life interactions and physical activities. With the right guidance and parents supervision, social media can be a valuable tool for growth without causing harm.
