# Essay Review

The author provided an essay about traveling and explained the stages of development that traveling has gone through. In addition, the author mentioned some potential challenges travelers could face and provided tips to improve their experiences. Overall, the essay was descriptive and discussed traveling from various perspectives and its effects on people from many aspects for both individuals and communities and stated many valid arguments. The essay explained how some global events affected traveling (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and highlighted as well how the advancements in technologies (such as health passports, mobile check-ins, and contactless payments) have reshaped the way we travel.  

Nevertheless, here are some issues that were identified:

### Absence of Subtitles  
The essay misses subheadings for paragraphs, which would add more clarity to the essay and keep the reader on track with the   sequence of the author's thoughts.  

### Transitions  
- Sometimes there were no smooth transitions between paragraphs, and sometimes there were no smooth transitions between sentences within the paragraph itself.  
- Moreover, there was no clear transition between some ideas as well. The writer started with the topic of travel, then specified the rest of the essay for tourism, which is not the only type of traveling (there could be more examples such as traveling for work or relocation).  

### Overusage  
- **Passive Voice:** In the text, passive voice was overused, which reduces the directness and impact of the essay.
- **Generalizations:** There was also overuse of generalizations without going deep enough to clarify the ideas to reflect the author's thoughts effectively.

### Fillers  
The text contains many meaningless fillers, which could be avoided to maintain cohesiveness of the text and focus of the reader.  

### Not Enough Proof
There was an absence of evidence for some claimed facts (such as the carbon footprint), which weakens the essayâ€™s reliability.  

### Unclarity  
The author mentioned an abbreviated term (GDP) without explaining what it stands for, at least for once throughout the text.

### AI Detection  
There was a high percentage of AI (more than 90%) to generate the text.


### Conclusion  
In conclusion, although the essay provides an overview of traveling and addresses key issues such as cultural shocks and language problems, it fails in terms of structure, coherence, and depth. The absence of subheadings, smooth transitions, and sufficient evidence diminishes its effectiveness. Moreover, the overuse of passive voice, generalizations, and fillers affects the impact of the essay. Some tips were provided for improvement such as fixing the structure, providing clear transitions, and supporting claims with solid evidence.
