# Peer Review 1

The author provided a clear, comprehensive, and well-structured guideline on entrepreneurship. In addition, the author followed the insights of Mohnish Pabrai, who is a popular entrepreneur known for his value investing philosophy.

Nevertheless, some issues were identified in the text:

### AI detection: 

The author heavily relied on AI instead of his own creativity as the text was 100% AI-generated according to QuillBot online tool.

### Generalization: 

The text lacks specification as the author provided very general plans.

**Example:** the author advised the audience to read books for continuous learning, without elaborating more and specifying the types of books the reader should read.

### Lack of Depth: 

The text lacks technical depth which is required in technical texts as the author wrote one statement or two for each bullet point.

**Example:** for the fifth point, the writer stated only: "Entrepreneurs must be personally invested in their venturesâ€”financially and emotionally" without providing more details.

### Not Enough Proof: 

The text lacks evidence and technical examples as the author claimed some ideas without providing solid evidence to support his claims and gain the readers' trust.

### Transition: 

There was a logical flow of the ideas in the text, but no smooth transition between the ideas or between the ideas and their supporting details. The author overused bullet points as the main structure for the text.

## Conclusion:
Although the writer emphasised the core principles of entrepreneurship and provided a concise and well-organized text, he relied heavily on AI and focused on giving general terms and advice instead of diving deeper to a technical level where he can convey his ideas and thoughts to the audience.
