# How to Become a Competitive Programmer

Competitive Programming (CP) is a mind sport where participants solve algorithmic tasks within time limits. It combines coding, mathematics, and logical thinking. There are real-world global contests such as ICPC and Olympiad competitions, but you can still improve your skills on online platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder. Whatever your aim is, this guide will help you succeed.

## Key Tips for Competitive Programming

### 1. Set a Clear Target
Train with clear and measurable goals to stay focused:
- Solve a specific number of problems weekly.
- Learn new algorithms or data structures monthly.

Clear targets ensure efficient practice and keep the flame of enthusiasm burning within you.

### 2. Practice with Friends
Collaborating with friends makes training more engaging and enjoyable:
- Compete to outperform each other, fostering healthy rivalry.
- Share insights and strategies for solving challenging problems.

Practicing together enhances motivation and provides fresh perspectives.

### 3. Take It Seriously
Approach CP with dedication:
- Schedule regular practice sessions.
- Treat it as a serious skill-development activity, rather than just a hobby.

Consistency and discipline are key to mastering competitive programming.

### 4. Expect a Reward
Set rewards to boost your motivation:
- Aim for milestones like improving your platform rank or solving a tough problem.
- Keep long-term rewards in mind, like winning competitions or enhancing career prospects.

Even if the reward takes time or is small, expecting a reward will provide you with a significant motivational boost.

### 5. Learn New Algorithms and Data Structures
Expand your toolkit by mastering advanced concepts such as:
- **Segment Trees** for range queries.
- **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** for handling connected components.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** for optimization problems.
- **Graph Traversal Techniques** (DFS, BFS) for solving graph-related tasks.

This approach equips you with powerful tools to tackle challenging tasks.

### 6. Don’t Solve Only Easy Tasks
Although it's recommended to start with solving easy tasks, focusing too much on them won't help you improve rather than waste your time.
- It’s good practice to increase the difficulty level of problems as your skills improve.
- Avoid spending too much time on extremely simple tasks.

Challenging yourself leads to faster improvement and deeper understanding.

### 7. Love Competitive Programming
Passion is the main driver for success:
- Focus on the joy of solving problems and learning new techniques.
- Enjoy the process rather than fixating solely on outcomes.
- Appreciate the beauty of training your brain to view problems from different angles.

Loving what you do makes it easier to stay committed through obstacles.

### 8. Check Editorials
You should understand that failure is part of training and does not indicate poor progress. Failure will eventually turn into success if you learn from your previous mistakes and discover new techniques and ways of thinking. That is why it's recommended to upsolve tasks which you could not solve during contests as doing so helps you identify new techniques, fix mistakes, and refine your thinking process.

So, keep in mind to "Upsolve" tasks you couldn’t complete during contests to turn "Failure" into "Progress".

## Conclusion
Becoming a competitive programmer requires consistent effort, curiosity, and passion. By following these tips, collaborating with friends, learning continuously, and embracing challenges, you’ll steadily improve.

Competitive programming is not just about winning contests; it’s about mastering the art of problem-solving!
